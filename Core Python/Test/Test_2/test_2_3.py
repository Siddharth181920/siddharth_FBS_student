'''A farmer has a field which is half in circle share and rest rectangle. He needs to do fencing
for entire field using barbed wire 5 times. Circular section has radius 20m and rectangle
length is 50 m and breadth is 40m. If cost of barbed wire is 35Rs/m then calculate the total
cost of fencing the field.'''
