

Python basic syntax can be executed by writing directly the command line.

print("Hello world")

output : - Hello world

python indentation refers to the spaces for beginning of the code line.
in a python indentation is very important

python uses indentation to indicate the block of code

we use print statement in python to show the output for user 
and we use the take input from user can use the input statment to accept the value form user.

input   - num = int (input("Enter the num : "))
output - print("The value of num is {num}")

always data accept in the string format in python when we receive input from user 
it is depends upon you need we can change it other data types .(that why data types is important )

we can check easily which is data type of this variable using following metods.

ex.. num = 15
     print(type(num))


* Python Variables

Rules : 
- Can contain alphabets and digits.
- Can't starts with digits.
- Can't contain special symbol except underscore(_).
- it is case sensitive .
- Can't use keyword as variables.

In python use variables for store the value and also it is a value holdres
when you need to assign a value then we can create a varibles .

x = 5
y = "Hello Student's " 

in above statment x and y it is varibles it is help to hold the values in varibles.

python has no command to declare the value , without command we can easily delare a variable in python.

in python we can add multiple assignment in a single variable. 

* Python comments 

In python comments is used for documentation purpose at the running time to coding , projects its easy to note for documentation.
mainly two types one is single line and second is multiline comments its use using the # amd ''' ''' symbol

single line commnets - # Hello world

multiline comments - ''' Hello world , How are you '''


* Identifires

Python Identifires is used to identity of the variable, function, class and moudules or other object.
an identifires start with A to Z and (a-z) , underscore (_) , and digits (0-9)

Python does't use punctuation characters / symbols to declare variables and identifires.
because python is a case sensitive programming language 

ex. Apple and apple it is a diffrent identifires in python .

In a python one class declare with uppercase letter and all identifires start with lowercase.
Starting identifires in single leading underscore it is denote private 
Starting identifires in two leading underscore it is denote higly private

* Kywords

Python keywords we can't use to declare as variable and constants keywords are
reservewords it is already declare in python.

Follwing are the keywords it also reservewords : 

and assert break class continue def del elif else except excec finally for from global if import in is lambda 
not or pass print raise return try while with yield.


* Data types

Every value in python has a data type .
Since everything is an python is as object in python programming.
Data types are actually classes and variables are instances of classes.

      Data type 

      Text                      - 'str'
      Numeric type              - int , float , complex.
      Sequence                  - list , tuple , range
      Mapping                   - dict 
      Set                       - set, frozenset
      Boolean                   - Bool      
      Binary                    - bytes, bytesarry, memoryview.



1. Text (str): in the text type : string is data type.

 string is hold a value in the text format . 

 ex. 
 name = str (input("Enter the instragam id of user : "))

 print(f"User Instragram id is : ")
 
 output : User Instragram id is : siddharth181920

2. Numeric(int,float,complex)

a. integer(int) : int data type store a interger value 
ex. 1,2,33,42,etc 

num = int(input("Enter the roll number : "))

print(f"The roll number is : {num}")

output : The roll number is : 129

b. Float : in a python float data type accept and store the decimal point value .

ex. 3.14, 1.3, 2.565... etc

point = float(input("Enter the first sem CGPA : "))

print(f"Your CGPA of First sem is : {point} ")
print(type(point))


c. complex : complex number of an ordered pair of floating point numbers.

ex. x+yj, a+b9, P*Q2..

cmp = complex(input("Enter the value for checking : "))

print(f" This is the complex value : {cmp}")

print(type(cmp))


3. Sequence (List, tuple,range)

In python Sequence is refer to stored data in the ordered formart , ecach sequence data types come with unique capabilities.

a. List : List are a single storage unit it is store multiple data items together.
          It is a mutable data structure it can be altered
          at the time declare list can use () either [] for declaration to list.

ex. 

 list_1 = [ "1. Ajay 2. karan 3. Akashay"]
 print(f"List_1: {list_1}")

 list_2 = ["a. Apple b. Mango c. Potato"] 
 print(f"List_2: {list_2}")

 list_3 = ()
 print(f"List_3 : {list_3}")


b.tuple : tuple is same as list only it is a immutable data type but it is store many data items but different data types.
          using parenthesis ( ) .

ex. 
   tuple_1 = ("Pune, Mumbai, Surat. ")
print(f"Tuple_1 : {tuple_1}")

tuple_2 = ("Dist, State, Country.")
print(f"Tuple_2 : {tuple_2}")

tuple_3 = ("")
print(f"Tuple_3 : {tuple_3}")



c. range : It returns a sequence of integers in a specified range , by default it start form o if not specified




** Operators .
               Operators in python is used to perform a operation on Variables and values 
               As the name suggest operators is operate the calculation. perform for basic task to excute the program.
               follwing are the different operators in python.
               1. Airthematic Operators : 
               2. Assignment Operators
               3. Comparision Operators
               4. Logical Operators
               5. Identity Operators
               6. Membershiop Operators
               7. Bitwise Operators


1. Airthematic Operators : it is use to perform common mathematical operation on numeric values.

  a. +  = addition
  b. *  = Multiplication
  c. -  = Substraction
  d. /  = division
  e. %  = moudules
  f. ** = Exponentiation
  g. // = floor division
